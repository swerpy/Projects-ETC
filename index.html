    <p> One of my motives when I feel I am personally bored is to read a nice good Book. This probably sounds cliche, and no arguments there! But personally the state of feeling snug and awash and lost in a good story portrayed in years more detail and emotion from simple regular events is leagues more superior than something on a screen, at least in my personal belief. But regardless of how I express my opinion, books are benficial and packed with knowledge even if you fail to see it as such. And as a person who constantly looks to improve, books form an adhesive which prevents me from getting bored nearly ever! These binders filled with pages serve as the backbone to inspiration, as well as a sense of time-management which overall when added up lead you to a more succesful path in your life-span. </p>

    <h1> MY WORKS </h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h3> As an aspiring writer, I have worked on improving my skills so much so as when I fall under that state, all forms of tangency fly by as I only focus on expressing my inner self and knowledge through words at those moments. So I had the urgency to believe it would be good to share some writings I have made since the early days of the pandemic as to reflect upon my growth. Books have certainly claimed their fair share of credit when it comes to me being a writer, and their overwhelming presence in my livelyhood has led to the following writing below. </h3>

    <h2> <u> <b> 5.3 Space Exploration Outline </b> </u> </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> Approximately 6 decades after the Space administration was founded there has been a controversial topic among the public. Even after all these years, has the International Space Station faded out of vision for our list of priorities? What is the purpose of going to Mars? Why must we observe the endless galaxies any longer? Just what is the purpose when we could put all that in more worthwhile areas like education and in the field of medicine! That, .. my fellow readers is the Million Dollar Question. </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> Space Exploration is not always about gazing at the stars, or looking through a telescope including our temptation to push our limits more but rather for the benefits on Earth. Think. Exploring the outer bounds of reality we are usually accustomed and tied with and can gladly refer to as the norm, have answered questions sitting there unanswered. Such as the concept of Gravity. A concept as simple and well known as this one has led to the unthinkable. Gravity to Rockets, to Exploration, to Technology and Entertainment. You see, the genius who came up with the self explanatory idea of the internet has been made possible by communication through space as information can be transferred up above the world renowned ever so high. So when referring to exploration, a simple example with a cause and effect is all that’s needed.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> Though Space is indeed the final frontier, expensive and boundless as a matter of fact, many have questioned the hassle required to fulfill the end goal. But with all the evidence out there, Space Exploration is vital to humanity whether you want to deny it or not. 72% of Americans believe Space Exploration is crucial for the U.S according to “Pew Research.com” which is coming from the country that built the I.S.S. Think about technology, how your daily life uses the internet. As well as resources such as minerals, ores etc. coming from asteroids. I know, sounds off. Not to mention the spiraling cycle of Projects and funds which when thought in a constructive mannerism, is the “skeleton” of these great discoveries if you will. </p>
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    <p> Technology is thriving, and guess what's responsible. You guessed it, Space. Through research and exploitation of Space (in a good way), modern art is born though the forefront of the digital world and the world of medicine. Humans never went through evolution to go to space though we defied that anyway. That action has led to the development of various technologies which improve our lives right here on Earth. </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> Where would we be now without the internet is a fun and trivial question. Looking closer, satellites would be responsible for the tragic downfall. Thinking the other way around however, this means that Satellites make the internet well possible. In fact as said by groundcontroll.com, “The orbiting satellite transmits (and receives) its information to a location on Earth called the Network Operations Center or NOC (pronounced "knock")”. The fleet of satellites in orbit transmit information globally as well as provide information for search engines and more. Obviously, Weather Channels also take information in the atmosphere due to our trusty friends satellites. </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> And as you all know Medicine is always a work in progress. Like the coronavirus vaccine to state a relevant example. And once again Space is also a driving factor in the field. How? Well the International Space Station actually doubles as a laboratory for investigations on Human Health and more. Factually provided by nasa.gov, “Through strenuous research, we have understood aging, trauma, diseases and the environment better than we have before”. A Microgravity Environment is where research is held. This weak gravity area is where effects on the Human body are observed and compared to different environments to find out the culprit. For reference, advances in telemedicine, disease models, psychological stress response systems, nutrition, cell behavior and environmental health have all been advanced into technologies such as the Heart Monitor and more. Another rather similar example as follows can be said though astronauts since this same form of gravity is what affects their bone mass as well as their muscle mass. To combat this, exercise must be done daily to prevent muscle and bone loss therefore rendering them weak and helpless if so. If we considered these industries as Space Exploration, more light would be shed on the topic. </p>
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    <p> As we continue to develop new technologies on Earth, the strain on our natural resources continues to increase drastically. The extraction of valuable minerals and more have led to a surplus of problems, including environmental damage and human exploitation, but a gold mine of precious materials resides in space. Initiatives like Planetary Resources are willing to mine asteroids instead of what Earth has to offer which would mean an unlimited supply of raw materials that are depleted on Earth. But is this really reliable? </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> There is quite a lot of potential hidden in these Space Rocks which contain numerous gases, minerals, as well as energy sources providing the opportunity and temptation to go further into Space. Truth is, the reality isn’t too far from us. Expeditions have been held to asteroids and other Space Rocks which have confirmed and made quite a few discoveries already. Quite frankly according to interestingenginering.com, “While the concept has been the stuff of science fiction for decades, it's only in the past few years that it's come to be viewed as a serious possibility. This has led to the creation of asteroid mining firms and the passage of legislation that recognizes the right of companies to prospect, claim, and extract space-based resources''. Missions to the Moon from many across the world have developed methods for mining in the near future that may take place. </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> An abundance of energy resides in Space. Through the form of gases such as helium-3. In Science, we know well that all energy comes from the Sun. So to get the maximum amount of energy we look up to the sun. I am not sure you have realized but Solar Power is a product of Space Exploration. Untold numbers of Space Crafts contain Solar Power to keep going harnessing the Sun’s energy. Explained by spaceplace.nasa gov, “Solar energy has also been used to power spacecraft on Mars. NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, and Mars” Phoenix lander all used power from solar panels and so did the InSight lander. If you see what space has to offer, you know that it has an impact on our daily lives excluding research”. And to embrace our understanding of this open region can help us in more ways than one. </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> Finances. Cash. Bills. Funds. Money has always been an issue in this world, even when it comes to Space Projects as much as we have the urge to resist it. But these funds are the “gasoline” of Space Exploration which allows it to thrive forevermore. Now, there is the assumption that channeling funds into space exploration and space-related ventures will deprive and prove demeaning to existing efforts on Earth. But allow me to get this straight. </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> When you get right to the main point, there is no logic whatsoever for believing money spent on scientific endeavors means less money for addressing problems here. According to Forbes, “There are many ways to address financial spendings and benefits through earnings. Modern satellite communications would not exist without space exploration (some of it military-focused, admittedly). Modern robotics, computers, digital photography and digital video, fuel cells, and many other key technologies received huge boosts from space-related R&D. Studies of space weather have been important for protecting satellites and preventing blackouts.” So when looking through a deeper perspective, the money saved is unimaginable in well, unimaginable terms. Space exploration has also been one of the most crucial drivers of science and technology education in the U.S. “Ask how many of today’s leading scientists and engineers were inspired by the space program and by the sci-fi or science based television shows which were fed on by today's engineers and scientists” a well established truth stated by Forbes. All these technologies made possible by space exploration have paved the way for technologies and satellites which in the end result can be rightfully compared to preventing blackouts as said before. Therefore meaning space exploration is beneficial, (chronologically speaking). And has there ever been a foundation which has led to not exploring the unknown? As explorers? </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> And more than just that, no guarantee is put in place that money that isn’t spent on space exploration would be put into these economical issues. Though the argument of space exploration appeals to justice and humanity, it is not created with reason. So with that said on the same subject, once again according to Forbes, “This is a line of thinking that's come up repeatedly throughout history. Yes, it's short-sighted, in that it fails to recognize that our greatest problems require long-term investment, and that society's greatest advances come about through hard work, research, development, and often are only realized years, decades, or generations after that investment is made. Investing in science is investing in the betterment of humanity.”That future isn’t plentiful everywhere, as when starvation in Africa is an issue to state a heartbreaking reality. But when it is existent, we shall strive for the opposite. Thinking that space exploration is a mere stunt won’t do any good. But rather what would come out of it. We struggled and persevered every step of the way and losing the utter motive to do so will leave the fresh meat for the buzzards. And remember when I said 72% of Americans believe that space is the right way to go? To be frank, that type of belief in the endless cosmos is just what we need to succeed to let the rockets make the sky their domain. Space still bears fruit as the results being found with the research held is staggering at a captivating degree. </p>
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    <p> There are many reasons out there which support Space Exploration. But us as a species, we have always been curious. That has been the very reason we evolved. To venture out which has become the driving force for all of civilization. Exploring Space not only allows us to discover new realms and build advanced technologies. But rather work toward a larger idea regardless of gender, race, and nationality. From the application of science through automation, mechanization, or machinery which rhythms in an infinite echo at seemingly lightspeed configurations paving the path we know as the Digital Age. And as this modern time brings new discoveries, it’s chime unearths the vast seemingly unlimited supply of resources waiting to be unlocked to its full potential. As when the possibilities awaken, we must channel our effort to make the effects real. And our imagination and belief in the cosmos is rather the biggest gasoline of all for Space Exploration. So nothing comes without effort and Space Exploration is an influential story over the ages of that reality. </p>
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    <p> So with that well said, If we prevent our curiosity and thirst to explore and embrace itself, we won’t be us. </p>
